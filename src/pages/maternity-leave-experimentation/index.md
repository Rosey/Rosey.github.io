title: Maternity Leave Experimentation

I’ve been on maternity leave for almost ten months now and I haven’t really accomplished that much.

It’s not that I went into mat leave with any specific expectations – but I thought I might do _something_ interesting. And in my daydrams I fantisized about accomplishing a TON, like keeping a perfectly clean house, writing a full-length novel, and learning so many new things about front end development.

In reality:

- 🏠 House is usually messy. Sometimes I go crazy and do a bunch of cleaning, but 2 days later it looks terrible again so it’s pretty demoralizing.
- 📚 I haven’t done anything super notable, although I have [read a lot more fiction](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774641-rose) that I do most years, which has been pleasant.
- 💻 I have spent some time on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7090310/rose-robertson) answering questions, which is sort of fun and rewarding when people thank you.
- 💻 I have spent some time contributing to open source, but not much. If you look at my [Github profile](https://github.com/Rosey/)’s history you’d probably roll your eyes and say “That’s it?!”
- 💻 I have also spent a bit of time working on a personal pet project related to my job.
- 💻 I have been blogging very regularly on [Life as Rose](https://lifeasrose.ca), but it is a private/personal blog about my daily activities, so nothing to see there!
- 💻 And now my latest project is this, what you are looking at right now! Trying out [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) and publishing it on roserobertson.me because this site isn’t doing anything anyway.
- 👶 And of course I have been taking care of my baby!
