I will have been off for a year at that point, living a life of leisure (lol 😐) taking care of a baby.</p>\n<p>My emotions are mixed! I’m excited, because I enjoy working (although let’s be honest, back when I left for maternity leave last year I was also very excited for a break from working 😇) and taking care of a baby is… well, it’s not so bad, but it’s pretty all-consuming so it will be nice to get away and do something else.</p>\n<p>I’m sad because I’m going to be away from Little P <strong>so much</strong>, and I have never been apart from her for more than an hour or two here and there.</p>\n<figure>\n    ![](./newbornbaby.jpg)\n    <figcaption>\n        Test\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I’m also sad because unless I take another year off for another baby (which may or may not happen, both a second baby and my decision for how much time to take for maternity leave – husband and I are seriously considering having him take the majority of the leave next time, if there is a next time) this may be the ONLY time in my life when I get such a large chunk of time off work… until I retire 😬</p>\n<p>And it’s terrifying for a reason I hadn’t anticipated: Baby still wakes up multiple times per night, so I am often very sleep deprived and my brain is not firing on all cylinders. This makes me both dumb AND grumpy, a really excellent combination. I don’t mind subjecting Ben to my stupid, angry self, but I do feel bad doing that to my coworkers. I naively thought that by age one things would be pretty good in the sleep department. OH HOW WRONG I WAS.</p>\n<p>So. I’m not really sure how it’s all going to go down!</p>\n<p>Lucky my employer is excellent and I know they’ll be very supportive during the transition back to work ❤️</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Going back to work","date":"November 05, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/going-back-to-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/maternity-leave-experimentation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Maternity Leave Experimentation"}},"next":null}}
