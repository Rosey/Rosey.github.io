I will have been off for a year at that point, living a life of leisure (lol) taking care of my first baby.</p>\n<p>My emotions are mixed! I am excited, because I enjoy working (although letâ€™s be honest, back when I left for maternity leave last year I was also very excited for a break from working ðŸ˜‡) and taking care of a kid isâ€¦ well, itâ€™s not so bad, but itâ€™s pretty all-consuming so it will be nice to get away and do something else.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m sad because Iâ€™m going to be away from my baby SO MUCH, the baby I have never been apart from for more than an hour or two per month.</p>\n<p>Also sad because unless I take another year of for another kid (which may or may not happen, both a second baby and my decision for how much time to take for maternity leave) this may be the ONLY time in my life when I get such a large chunk of time off workâ€¦ until I retire ðŸ˜¬</p>\n<p>And itâ€™s terrifying for a reason I hadnâ€™t anticipated: Baby still wakes up multiple times per night, so I am often very sleep deprived and my brain is not firing on all cylinders. I naively thought that by age 1 things would be pretty good in this regard. OH HOW WRONG I WAS.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Going back to work","date":"November 05, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/going-back-to-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/setting-up-vscode/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting Up Visual Studio Code"}},"next":null}}
