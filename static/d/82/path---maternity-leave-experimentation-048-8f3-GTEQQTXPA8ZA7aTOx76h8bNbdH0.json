And in my daydrams I fantisized about accomplishing a TON, like keeping a perfectly clean house, writing a full-length novel, and learning so many new things about front end development.</p>\n<p>In reality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>🏠 House is usually messy. Sometimes I go crazy and do a bunch of cleaning, but 2 days later it looks terrible again so it’s pretty demoralizing.</li>\n<li>📚 I haven’t done anything super notable, although I have <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774641-rose\">read a lot more fiction</a> that I do most years, which has been pleasant.</li>\n<li>💻 I have spent some time on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7090310/rose-robertson\">Stackoverflow</a> answering questions, which is sort of fun and rewarding when people thank you.</li>\n<li>💻 I have spent some time contributing to open source, but not much. If you look at my Github profile’s history you’d probably roll your eyes and say “That’s it?!”</li>\n<li>💻 I have also spent a bit of time working on a personal pet project related to my job.</li>\n<li>💻 I have been blogging very regularly on Life as Rose, but it is a private/personal blog about my daily activities, so nothing to see there!</li>\n<li>💻 And now my latest project is this, what you are looking at right now! Trying out Gatsby and publishing it on roserobertson.me because this site isn’t doing anything anyway.</li>\n<li>👶 And of course I have been taking care of my baby!</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Maternity Leave Experimentation","date":"March 22, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/maternity-leave-experimentation/","previous":null,"next":null}}
