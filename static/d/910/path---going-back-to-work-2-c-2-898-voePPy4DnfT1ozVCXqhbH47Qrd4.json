I will have been off for a year at that point, living a life of leisure (lol) taking care of my first baby.</p>\n<p>My emotions are mixed! Iâ€™m excited, because I enjoy working (although letâ€™s be honest, back when I left for maternity leave last year I was also very excited for a break from working ðŸ˜‡) and taking care of a kid isâ€¦ well, itâ€™s not so bad, but itâ€™s pretty all-consuming so it will be nice to get away and do something else.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m sad because Iâ€™m going to be away from my baby SO MUCH, the baby I have never been apart from for more than an hour or two.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/c286f/newbornbaby.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.27239488117002%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBAgQF/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFXM66ZqNIbE1XKaQz/AP/EAB0QAQABBAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMREiEiMTL/2gAIAQEAAQUCkOr1mcgO1+GxbOg8PznFewnWCv/EABkRAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEBEhIv/aAAgBAwEBPwFehcFsqP/EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgIf/aAAgBAgEBPwExP//EAB0QAAICAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBEhAxJBUWH/2gAIAQEABj8CxCaE6LQhdbcRyab9FH//xAAcEAACAwEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUHBYYH/2gAIAQEAAT8hybccC5KIQImXB1QmoSecEAt4LjwikH1K2/YBqYTLWmh++Rmif//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQww5N/8QAGREBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQESFB/9oACAEDAQE/EA6dOjiZJ//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBKhBIjP//EAB4QAQADAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExUUFhcYGh/9oACAEBAAE/EEjYqU8HljQLTvjGDmEK6jA1B8F5+7ANHrBAwLNHylygwXnr7WTeIt1GFw1oK3RAAbJD6byNVOLs71AhS13P/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"newbornbaby\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/f8fb9/newbornbaby.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/e8976/newbornbaby.jpg 148w,\n/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/63df2/newbornbaby.jpg 295w,\n/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/f8fb9/newbornbaby.jpg 590w,\n/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/85e3d/newbornbaby.jpg 885w,\n/static/85e3bfe2b2c252ca2a80eabf43592b5c/c286f/newbornbaby.jpg 1094w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Also sad because unless I take another year off for another baby (which may or may not happen, both a second baby and my decision for how much time to take for maternity leave â€“ husband and I seriously considering him take the majority of the leave next time, if there is a next time) this may be the ONLY time in my life when I get such a large chunk of time off workâ€¦ until I retire ðŸ˜¬</p>\n<p>And itâ€™s terrifying for a reason I hadnâ€™t anticipated: Baby still wakes up multiple times per night, so I am often very sleep deprived and my brain is not firing on all cylinders. This makes me both dumb AND grumpy, a really excellent combination. I donâ€™t mind subjecting Ben to my stupid, angry self, but I do feel bad doing that to my coworkers. I naively thought that by age one things would be pretty good in the sleep department. OH HOW WRONG I WAS.</p>\n<p>So Iâ€™m not really sure how itâ€™s all going to go down!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Going back to work","date":"November 05, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/going-back-to-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/maternity-leave-experimentation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Maternity Leave Experimentation"}},"next":null}}
