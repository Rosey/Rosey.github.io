I will have been off for a year at that point, living a life of leisure (lol üòê) taking care of a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My emotions are mixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ú® I‚Äôm excited, because I enjoy working (although let‚Äôs be honest, back when I left for maternity leave last year I was also very excited for a break from working üòá) and taking care of a baby is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs not so bad, but it‚Äôs pretty all-consuming so it will be nice to get away and do something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ú® I‚Äôm also excited because I really like my coworkers and spending time with them is kind of like spending time with friends. Is that sad? Is that weird? Please tell me that it is neither sad nor weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üò¢ On the other hand, I‚Äôm sad because I‚Äôm going to be away from Little P &lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt;, and I have never been apart from her for more than an hour or two here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        Me and baby P a day or two after she was born
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üò¢ AND: Unless I take another year off for another baby (which may or may not happen, both a second baby and my decision for how much time to take for maternity leave ‚Äì husband and I are seriously considering having him take the majority of the leave next time, if there is a next time) this may be the ONLY time in my life when I get such a large chunk of time off work‚Ä¶ until I retire üò¨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Finally, going back to work is terrifying for a reason I hadn‚Äôt anticipated: Baby still wakes up multiple times per night, so I am often very sleep deprived and my brain is not firing on all cylinders. This makes me both dumb AND grumpy, a really excellent combination. I don‚Äôt mind subjecting Ben to my stupid, angry self, but I do feel bad doing that to my coworkers. I naively thought that by age one things would be pretty good in the sleep department. OH HOW WRONG I WAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. I‚Äôm not really sure how it‚Äôs all going to go down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky my employer is excellent and I know they‚Äôll be very supportive during the transition back to work ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it will be interesting. Hopefully it is relatively smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In news that is absolutely not news to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, juggling a career and kids as a woman is kind of shitty. Your attention is so split between family and work, you‚Äôre sleep deprived, and you have to take time off work every time you have a baby which puts you at a disadvantage for promotions and just staying current in the industry (üôÑ). I know some men might say they have it tough too, and I‚Äôm sure they do, but just looking at my own family situation: I have it WAY worse than my husband does, no doubt. And I‚Äôm so torn, because on the one hand I really love my job and want to pursue it to the fullest, but on the other hand I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúWhen I die, what will I regret more: Time not spent with my children or a career unfulfilled?‚Äù And the answer is pretty obvious in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I am very thankful I am in a situation where I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; take a year off. I cannot imagine having to go back to work only a few weeks after giving birth. I would have been a total mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll try to write an update on how it all looks in reality once I‚Äôm back and in the swing of things üòä&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maternity Leave Experimentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[I‚Äôve been on maternity leave for almost ten months now and I haven‚Äôt really accomplished that much.

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not that I went into mat leave with any specific expectations ‚Äì but I thought I might do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; interesting. And in my daydrams I fantisized about accomplishing a TON, like keeping a perfectly clean house, writing a full-length novel, and learning so many new things about front end development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üè† House is usually messy. Sometimes I go crazy and do a bunch of cleaning, but 2 days later it looks terrible again so it‚Äôs pretty demoralizing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üìö I haven‚Äôt done anything super notable, although I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774641-rose&quot;&gt;read a lot more fiction&lt;/a&gt; that I do most years, which has been pleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíª I have spent some time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/7090310/rose-robertson&quot;&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; answering questions, which is sort of fun and rewarding when people thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíª I have spent some time contributing to open source, but not much. If you look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Rosey/&quot;&gt;Github profile&lt;/a&gt;‚Äôs history you‚Äôd probably roll your eyes and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?!‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíª I have also spent a bit of time working on a personal pet project related to my job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíª I have been blogging very regularly on &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifeasrose.ca&quot;&gt;Life as Rose&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a private/personal blog about my daily activities, so nothing to see there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíª And now my latest project is this, what you are looking at right now! Trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; and publishing it on roserobertson.me because this site isn‚Äôt doing anything anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üë∂ And of course I have been taking care of my baby!&lt;/li&gt;
