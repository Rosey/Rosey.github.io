&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I went into mat leave with any specific expectations – but I thought I might do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; interesting. And in my daydrams I fantisized about accomplishing a TON, like keeping a perfectly clean house, writing a full-length novel, and learning so many new things about front end development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏠 House is usually messy. Sometimes I go crazy and do a bunch of cleaning, but 2 days later it looks terrible again so it’s pretty demoralizing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📚 I haven’t done anything super notable, although I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774641-rose&quot;&gt;read a lot more fiction&lt;/a&gt; that I do most years, which has been pleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💻 I have spent some time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/7090310/rose-robertson&quot;&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; answering questions, which is sort of fun and rewarding when people thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💻 I have spent some time contributing to open source, but not much. If you look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Rosey/&quot;&gt;Github profile&lt;/a&gt;’s history you’d probably roll your eyes and say “That’s it?!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💻 I have also spent a bit of time working on a personal pet project related to my job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💻 I have been blogging very regularly on &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifeasrose.ca&quot;&gt;Life as Rose&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a private/personal blog about my daily activities, so nothing to see there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💻 And now my latest project is this, what you are looking at right now! Trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; and publishing it on roserobertson.me because this site isn’t doing anything anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👶 And of course I have been taking care of my baby!&lt;/li&gt;
